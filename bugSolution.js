// Potential solution:  Ensure Tailwind directives are correctly placed and your build process is completely cleaning up old files.  Consider a cache busting technique or a more aggressive cleaning strategy during the build. 
// Example using a cache-busting technique (adapt to your build system): 
const buildTime = Date.now();

// ... your Tailwind CSS config ...

// ... your application code ...
